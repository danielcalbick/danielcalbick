This "branch" of is a repository meant to hold all of the files and functions that I use in the main README.md's branch. I made it so that I could play around with obscuring the information that I wanted hidded in the main branch. This readme is here to remind me what I did so that I can understand this warren of commits and pushes. But if you're here I suppose its because you were interested in what was going on so maybe it'll be of interest to you too.
